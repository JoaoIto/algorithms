# Books ðŸ“˜

 Let's say we get a gift card at a bookstore for X, say, fifty reais, one hundred reais, and we want to get that gift card in programming books...

We went to the bookstore's website, looked for a programming book, and got some options. But the bookstore website brought us these options â€“ a JavaScript book (U$25.00), a PHP book (U$ 15.00), a Java book (U$ 30.00), Elixir (U$50.00), Go (U$45.00) and Python (U$20.00) â€“ which are not in any particular order that we can see.
What can we buy with our money? In order for us to know this, we have to know which are the cheapest books, how do I add it up, etc.

# 

- First, since we're dealing with a comparison of objects in an array, let's do it literally! We are going to impose an array with all the books being objects with a title and price, thus helping it further with more specific situations and making it more manageable and simple to understand.

- That established, we now need to use this own array of free objects as a direct module for our algorithm. It just uses the export module command. Once we've set this up, we'll make sure these objects can be exported wherever they're called, using the file only as a component of our main code!

- Right at the beginning of the code, we have already imported our book module, and so we only use its properties, and so depending on what can be placed there, already comparing its values and displaying it inside the console, as requested! Note that now we don't use variables directly, since we simply have an object with all the properties, we just put them as a parameter.

- And so then we simply need to ask the console to display the parameters of the book title and its price already passed through the entire algorithm...
