# ``Sort()`` method ordenation

**In this study we will use the most complex parts of the most difficult algorithms, coming from the second part of our immersion, which will feature algorithm and search codes! Even more depth in how we treat algorithms in a functional code!**

- **Learn more examples of sorting and searching algorithms**
- **Understand the concepts and paradigms behind the algorithms studied**
- **Develop the practice of translating algorithm logic into code**
- **Analyze the code of an algorithm to understand its complexity**
- **See how algorithms solve computing problems**
